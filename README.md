This is an application meant for SectorLabs evaluation created in React.
I managed to implement all the functionality required in the assignment.

To start the application, enter the my-app folder and run the command: npm start

Usage: Enter a username in the text field and press the button. It should show the all the user's gists and other relevant info.

Some improvements could be done on the aspect of the application, but as of now, it gets the job done.
As for the security part, the github token should not be stored in plaintext. For future releases, it could be read from a local file which is not accessible from github. Each application user then should enter their github token in this file in order to use the application.
